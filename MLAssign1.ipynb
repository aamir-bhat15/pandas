    "\n",
    "There are two main areas where supervised machine learning comes in handy: classification problems and regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification\n",
    "Classification refers to taking an input value and mapping it to a discrete value. In classification problems, our output typically consists of classes or categories. This could be things like trying to predict what objects are present in an image (a cat/ a dog) or whether it is going to rain today or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of the most common algorithms in Supervised Learning include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest.\n",

    "Unsupervised Machine Learning Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning models can perform more complex tasks than Supervised Learning models, but they are also more unpredictable. Here are the main tasks that utilize this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering:\n",
    "Clustering is the type of Unsupervised Learning where we find hidden patterns in the data based on their similarities or differences. These patterns can relate to the shape, size, or color and are used to group data items or create clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of clustering algorithms, such as exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association:\n",
    "Association is the kind of Unsupervised Learning where we can find the relationship of one data item to another data item. We can then use those dependencies and map them in a way that benefits us—e.g., understanding consumers' habits regarding our products can help us develop better cross-selling strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The association rule is used to find the probability of co-occurrence of items in a collection. These techniques are often utilized in customer behavior analysis in e-commerce websites and OTT platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "As the name suggests, the algorithm works to reduce the dimensions of the data. It is used for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting the important features from the dataset is an essential aspect of machine learning algorithms. This helps reduce the number of random variables in the dataset by filtering irrelevant features.\n",
