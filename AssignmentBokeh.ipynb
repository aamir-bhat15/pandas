        "\n",
        "1. Axes: We can customize the appearance of the axes by modifying attributes like `x_axis_label` and `y_axis_label` for setting axis labels, `x_axis_type` and `y_axis_type` for specifying the scale type, `x_range` and `y_range` for setting custom data ranges, and many more.\n",

        "2. Title: Set the title of the plot using the `title` attribute of the figure object. We can change the font size, font family, or position of the title by modifying additional attributes like `title_text_font_size`, `title_text_font`, and `title_location`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Legend: If we have multiple glyphs or data series, we can add a legend to help distinguish them. To include a legend, we can add the `legend` argument to the glyph creation methods (e.g., `circle()`, `line()`) and specify a legend label. We can further customize the legend's appearance using attributes like `legend_label`, `legend_location`, `legend_spacing`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Colors and Styles: Bokeh offers various ways to customize the colors and styles of glyphs. We can set the `color` attribute to change the color of a glyph. Additionally, Bokeh provides numerous built-in palettes for specifying color sequences. We can also modify line styles like `line_width`, `line_dash`, or fill styles like `fill_color`, `fill_alpha` for different glyphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Background and Grid: We can modify the background color of the plot using the `background_fill_color` attribute. Customize grid lines using attributes like `xgrid_grid_line_color`, `xgrid_grid_line_alpha`, `ygrid_grid_line_dash`, etc.\n",
