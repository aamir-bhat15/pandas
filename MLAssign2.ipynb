    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. This means that the model has learned the noise and random fluctuations in the training data, and it will perform poorly on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting are poor generalization and high variance, which means that the model will have low accuracy on new data.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. This means that the model will perform poorly on both the training and test data, and it will have low accuracy. The consequences of underfitting are poor performance and high bias, which means that the model is not complex enough to capture the patterns in the data.\n",

    "1. Regularization: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function of the model to discourage large weights and overfitting.\n",

    "2. Dropout: This involves randomly dropping out some of the neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on specific features and prevent overfitting.\n",
